            Hello, Iâ€™m Patrick Dunn, a full-stack web developer specializing in
            the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. With a sharp
            understanding of the mobile-first approach, I prioritize building
            responsive, lightweight, and component-driven applications. With 3
            years of hands-on experience in web development and technology
            education, I excel in collaborative environments. My strong
            communication skills enable me to seamlessly engage with clients and
            team members to ensure timely, high-quality results. Feel free to
            explore my projects, delve into my GitHub repositories, or check out
            my latest articles on Medium. I look forward to collaborating with
            you and bringing your ideas to life!
